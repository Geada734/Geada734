Hi! I'm Francisco Geada Rodr√≠guez from Mexico. I love coding, both as a job and as a hobby and have been working in the industry for 3 years now as a full stack developer. I'm primarily interested in web development, blockchain, data science, bots, and mobile development. In this repository you will find my school projects (from way back then) as well as the things I develop in my own time (mostly web apps).
