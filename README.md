Hi! I'm Francisco Geada Rodr√≠guez from Mexico. I love coding, both as a job and as a hobby and have been working in the industry for 5 years now as a full stack developer. I'm primarily interested in web development, blockchain, data science, bots, and mobile development. In this repository you will find the things I develop on my own time (mostly web apps).
